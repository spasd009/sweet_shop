## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 17 or higher** - [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- **Maven 3.6+** - [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **MySQL 8.0+** (optional, H2 works by default)

### Backend Setup

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshit9604/sweet-shop.git
cd sweet-shop
```

#### Step 2: Build the Project

```bash
# Clean and build
mvn clean install

# Or just compile
mvn compile
```

#### Step 3: Run the Backend

**Option A: Using Maven (Recommended)**
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Option B: Using JAR**
```bash
# Build JAR first
mvn clean package

# Run JAR
java -jar target/sweet-shop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The backend will start on **http://localhost:8081**

#### Step 4: Verify Backend is Running

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8081/api/auth/ping

# Should return: OK
```

#### Step 5: Database Configuration (Optional)

**Default (H2 - No Setup Required):**
- The application uses H2 in-memory database by default
- No configuration needed - works immediately!

**MySQL Configuration (Optional):**
1. Create a MySQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE sweetshop;
   ```

2. Update `src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sweetshop
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

3. Run with MySQL profile:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql
   ```

### Frontend Setup

#### Step 1: Navigate to Frontend Directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages:
- react
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- axios
- vite
- @vitejs/plugin-react

#### Step 3: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on **http://localhost:3000**

#### Step 4: Build for Production (Optional)

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Separate Terminals (Development)

1. **Terminal 1 - Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd sweet-shop
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   Wait for: `Started SweetShopApplication`

2. **Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd sweet-shop/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Wait for: `Local: http://localhost:3000`

3. **Open Browser:**
   - Visit: **http://localhost:3000**
   - You should see the login page!

#### Option 2: Integrated (Production Build)

The frontend is built into the backend's static resources, so you can run just the backend:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:8081**

## 🤖 My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used

I used **GitHub Copilot** and **Claude (via Cursor)** extensively throughout this project to accelerate development, learn best practices, and solve complex problems.

### How I Used AI

#### 1. **Code Generation & Boilerplate**

**GitHub Copilot:**
- Generated Spring Boot controller structures
- Created React component templates
- Implemented JWT authentication filter
- Generated database repository interfaces
- Created service layer method signatures

**Claude (Cursor):**
- Created complete component implementations (Login, Register, Dashboard, AdminPanel)
- Generated comprehensive test cases
- Wrote API documentation
- Created deployment configurations (Dockerfile, Railway config)
- Generated security configuration files

#### 2. **Problem Solving & Debugging**

**Error Resolution:**
- Used AI to understand error messages and stack traces
- Found solutions for JWT token validation issues
- Resolved Spring Security configuration conflicts
- Fixed React state management problems
- Debugged Railway deployment connection issues

**Specific Examples:**
- **Railway Deployment:** AI helped diagnose and fix MySQL connection failures by suggesting H2 fallback configuration
- **JWT Implementation:** AI assisted in debugging token expiration and validation issues
- **React Routing:** AI helped resolve SPA routing issues with Spring Boot static resources

#### 3. **Code Review & Best Practices**

**Code Quality:**
- AI suggested refactoring to follow SOLID principles
- Improved error handling patterns
- Optimized database queries
- Enhanced security configurations
- Suggested React best practices (hooks, state management)

#### 4. **Documentation**

**README Generation:**
- AI assisted in structuring comprehensive documentation
- Wrote clear setup instructions
- Created API documentation examples
- Generated deployment guides
- Created troubleshooting sections

#### 5. **Learning & Understanding**

**Concept Clarification:**
- Used AI to understand JWT token flow and implementation
- Learned Spring Security filter chains
- Grasped React hooks and state management
- Understood RESTful API design patterns
- Learned Docker and deployment best practices

### Specific Examples

#### Example 1: JWT Implementation
```java
// AI suggested this structure for JWT service
@Service
public class JwtService {
    // Token generation with custom claims
    // Token validation
    // Username and role extraction
}
```

**My Process:**
1. Used Copilot to generate initial structure
2. Manually added custom claims (username, role, userId)
3. AI helped debug token expiration issues
4. Final implementation combines AI suggestions with manual refinement

#### Example 2: React Components
```jsx
// AI generated complete Dashboard component
function Dashboard() {
    // State management
    // API integration
    // Search and filter logic
    // Purchase functionality
}
```

**My Process:**
1. Used Claude to generate complete component structure
2. Manually integrated API calls
3. Added custom styling
4. Tested and refined based on requirements

#### Example 3: Security Configuration
```java
// AI suggested Spring Security filter chain
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    // JWT filter integration
    // Public vs protected endpoints
    // CSRF configuration
}
```

**My Process:**
1. AI suggested initial configuration
2. Manually added JWT filter
3. Configured role-based access
4. Tested security with different user roles

#### Example 4: Database Configuration
```properties
# AI helped create Railway deployment config
# With H2 fallback for easier deployment
spring.datasource.url=${MYSQL_HOST:jdbc:h2:mem:sweetshop}
```

**My Process:**
1. AI suggested H2 fallback approach
2. Created multiple profile configurations
3. Tested with both H2 and MySQL
4. Refined based on deployment requirements

### Reflection on AI Impact

#### Challenges

- 🔍 **Verification:** Had to carefully review AI-generated code
  - Not all suggestions were correct
  - Some code needed manual refinement
  - Required understanding of the code, not just copying

- 🎯 **Context:** Sometimes needed multiple iterations to get desired output
  - Had to provide clear context
  - Iterative refinement needed
  - Some suggestions were too generic

- 🧠 **Understanding:** Still needed to understand the code, not just copy it
  - Required learning the concepts
  - Needed to adapt AI code to project needs
  - Had to maintain code quality standards

#### Best Practices I Followed

- ✅ **Always reviewed and understood AI-generated code**
  - Never blindly copied code
  - Tested thoroughly before committing
  - Refactored to match project standards

- ✅ **Used AI as a learning tool, not just a code generator**
  - Asked questions to understand concepts
  - Used explanations to learn
  - Applied learnings to other parts of the project

- ✅ **Documented AI usage transparently**
  - This README section
  - Commit messages when AI was used
  - Code comments where AI suggestions were used

- ✅ **Maintained code quality**
  - Followed project conventions
  - Wrote tests for AI-generated code
  - Reviewed and refactored as needed

### AI Co-authorship

All commits where AI was significantly used include co-authorship:

```
Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: Claude <claude@anthropic.com>
```

### Percentage of AI Assistance

- **Code Generation:** ~60% (boilerplate, templates, common patterns)
- **Problem Solving:** ~40% (debugging, error resolution)
- **Documentation:** ~70% (README, guides, comments)
- **Learning:** ~50% (concept clarification, best practices)

**Overall:** AI assisted in approximately **50-60%** of the development process, with the remaining work being manual implementation, testing, refinement, and understanding.
